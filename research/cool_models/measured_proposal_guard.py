"""Require a measured, non-trust-limited correction in strict research runs.

The generic nonlinear driver can stop after an accepted small step. A small
accepted step may be due to trust clipping or line search, rather than a small
computed correction. Keep that generic behavior unchanged, but do not use it
to certify these DAB experiments. This wrapper changes acceptance of a final
convergence claim, not the physical residual, Jacobian, or trial direction.
