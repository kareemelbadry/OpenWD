"""TMAP-style hybrid temperature correction for the full-NLTE PG1159 structure.

The shared Newton path eliminates the populations and differentiates the flux
profile with a fixed-radiation tangent.  Near the PG 1159-035 root that tangent
misses the non-local population-radiation coupling and drives single cells into
spurious cold or hot states.  TMAP instead iterates

    formal solution -> local (per-depth) correction with an approximate
    lambda operator -> population update

so the non-local coupling is carried by the repeated formal solutions rather
than by a global Jacobian (Werner & Dreizler 1999; Werner et al. 2003; TMAP
User's Guide).  This module supplies the temperature step of that loop.

* Upper cells (emission below the stellar flux): local radiative equilibrium
  ``int (kappa J - eta) = 0`` linearized in the cell temperature, with the
  populations, charge and radiation re-solved together at each depth with
  ``J = J0 + Lambda* (S - S0)`` (the per-depth linearization of TMAP with the
  populations eliminated locally).
* Deeper cells: the plane-parallel Unsöld-Lucy correction in flux-mean optical
  depth (Lucy 1964), in its NLTE form with the actual emissivity:
  ``dB = [kappa_J J - int eta + kappa_J dJ] / kappa_P`` with
  ``dJ = 3 int_0^tau (H0 - H) dtau' + 2 (H0 - H(0))``.  TMAP's guide notes that
  Unsöld-Lucy is reliable in the inner atmosphere but not in the line-forming
  outer layers, which is why those use the local lambda-operator form.

All quantities are per unit mass on the structure wavelength grid.
