# OpenWD documentation

OpenWD turns a white dwarf's temperature, surface gravity, and composition
into a model atmosphere and surface spectrum. Start with one fresh calculation,
inspect its convergence status, then change the parameters for your application.

## Using OpenWD

1. [Get started](getting-started.md): install, run a model, and read the outputs.
2. [Interactive notebook](../examples/generate_spectrum.ipynb): edit parameters
   and plot the resulting spectrum.
3. [Choose a model](models/README.md): DA, DB, DAB/DBA, and DZ/DBZ physics.
4. [Caveats and limitations](limitations.md): convergence, accuracy, and
   [tested temperatures and compositions](tested-temperature-ranges.md).

## Developing OpenWD

- [Development and regression policy](development/README.md): local workflow
  and checks that protect existing models.
- [Performance](development/performance.md): compiled acceleration and threads.
- [Solver diagnostics](development/solver-telemetry.md): interpreting iteration
  logs and convergence evidence.
- [Research history](development/history/README.md): dated investigations,
  rejected experiments, and detailed validation records. These are not the
  current user instructions.
