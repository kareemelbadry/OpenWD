# DO and DAO: experimental restricted NLTE

[Model guide](README.md) · [Development checks](../development/README.md)

`DOConfig` describes pure helium. `DAOConfig` describes homogeneous hydrogen
and helium, with `log_hydrogen_to_helium = log10(N(H)/N(He))`; the default 2
means 100 hydrogen nuclei per helium nucleus. These are new experimental
adapters, not a validated temperature/composition grid.

Select these presets explicitly with `DOConfig` or `DAOConfig`. A high
temperature in `DBConfig`, `DABConfig` or `DAConfig` does not switch that
request to NLTE automatically.

```python
from wd_spectra import DAOConfig, ModelData, run_model

run_model(
    DAOConfig(effective_temperature=60000, logg=8,
              log_hydrogen_to_helium=2, quality="standard"),
    "results/dao-60000",
    data=ModelData.default("/path/to/atomic-data-workspace"),
    require_convergence=True,
)
```

For pure helium use `DOConfig` and `compute_do`; the mixed counterpart is
`compute_dao`. Both return `ModelResult`, including the population state.
`save_model_result` writes the spectrum, atmosphere, metadata and diagnostic
`populations.npz`. Public runs start from a newly constructed continuum atmosphere and a fresh
shared-solver LTE initialization. They do not take a saved atmosphere. `quick`
skips the LTE initialization and attempts two coupled Newton iterations; it is
a smoke check, not a production equilibrium calculation.

## Solver and retained atom

Logarithmic temperatures and independent elemental population ratios are
solved simultaneously on a hydrostatic column-mass grid. The common
`solve_trust_region_newton` implementation owns trust bounds, trial acceptance
and termination. The adapter supplies the coupled statistical-equilibrium,
cell-energy and lower-boundary flux equations and their nonlocal transfer
response. It refreshes the coupled Jacobian without Broyden updates.

Nonphysical statistical-equilibrium populations in a proposed trial cause
the common solver to backtrack. An invalid initial or accepted state still
fails, as do unrelated data, input and programming errors.

After two completely rejected Newton directions in the full-NLTE stage,
the adapter enables bounded population restoration on trial steps. For an
optically thin layer with a large temperature correction, it can also propose
a bracketed thermal root, refined through the full transfer equations and
coupled to the neighboring layers. The common solver accepts a proposal only
if it reduces the full residual merit, rebuilds the Jacobian after a material
correction, and requires an ordinary Newton attempt between corrections.
These recovery proposals cannot certify convergence. The final independent
temperature, population, flux, energy, source and boundary checks are unchanged.
`hot_nlte_recovery` records activation and the extra work in atmosphere metadata.
After activation, a changed accepted state gets a fresh tangent before the next
recovery direction; reusing an earlier state's tangent can point uphill even
after its populations have been restored. These extra Jacobians are counted
separately from the common driver's evaluations.

Within each Jacobian, material derivative columns reuse two frozen transfer
responses, to source and relative-extinction changes. A new Jacobian constructs
a new operator. Temporary temperature-profile caches are released after
their derivatives are collected, and continuum sums process wavelengths in
batches to limit temporary storage. These optimizations retain the original
equations, wavelength/depth grids and convergence thresholds. Combining the
cached transfer responses changes floating-point operation order in the
Jacobian: a full 40-layer comparison preserved the residual bit-for-bit and
changed Jacobian entries by at most 1.16e-13.

Planck-to-NLTE continuation initializes the full equations. Only its final,
fully NLTE stage can receive an atmosphere certificate.
`population_maximum_iterations` caps coupled iterations per stage, also
bounded by the selected quality budget. Mixed models start with a deeper
column-mass grid to screen the thermal lower boundary.

The atom retains the research implementation's 14 He I terms, configurable
He II shells (32 by default) and He III continuum, with optional hydrogen
(8 levels plus H II by default; up to 20 explicit H levels may be selected
for atom-resolution checks). Each element has its own conservation row.
Hydrogen and helium now see the same radiation field, including overlapping
opacity, and share one Thomson-scattering contribution. Electron scattering
is solved directly by the release's column-mass Feautrier solver. The energy
residual uses absorption times mean intensity minus emissivity; it does not
replace NLTE emissivity with a Planck source.

The transfer equations use emissivity directly and permit signed net
absorption from stimulated emission where total extinction stays positive.
They do not divide by net absorption inside the atmosphere, clip negative
terms, or accept a nonfinite/negative radiation field. The thermal bottom
condition still requires positive absorption. Where gain is present, lower
boundary screening measures its contribution through the actual coupled
transfer operator; an absorption-only escape estimate would not suffice.

The legacy collision prescriptions and high-level closures are retained:
TLUSTY He I fits, hydrogen CCC rates, TLUSTY/Mihalas hydrogenic rates for He II and the
existing high-shell extrapolations. Explicit line-rate transfer covers the
existing He I components, He II lower shells 1–3 plus every retained optical Pickering transition,
and H lower shells 1–4 within the retained profile tables (including Brackett
upper shells through 14);
other rate transitions retain the atom's Planck-field closure. The existing
population-inversion prescriptions remain in effect. DO/DAO explicitly select
`Tremblay26.txt` for He I and `series-adaptive` interpolation for He II, matching
the legacy hot-DO benchmark. These choices are recorded in the configuration;
they do not change the profile defaults of the other model families.

The retained CCC reader cutoff is n=8, including for optional larger H atoms;
above it hydrogen uses the existing TLUSTY/Mihalas prescription. Shell-9 CCC
data are available, but enabling them would change the physical rates and
requires separate validation. `ccc_maximum_level` and the collision closures
are recorded in result/population metadata. The default He II prescription is
`tlusty-mihalas`, independently of the loaded CCC cutoff.

The He I collision polynomial is bounded to its Chebyshev coordinate interval
(1,000--50,000 K). Outside it, the effective collision strength is held at the
endpoint while the kinetic and Boltzmann factors use the actual temperature.
Unbounded legacy extrapolation produces negative rates above roughly 100,000 K.
This is an explicit approximate closure, not new high-temperature collision data.

## Limitations and certification

**The electron density and gas-pressure closure remain LTE.** Temperature
changes rebuild the shared H/He occupation-probability EOS, but NLTE
ionization departures do not update its electron density or pressure.
Consequently this is restricted NLTE, not a fully charge-consistent hot-star
atmosphere. Metals, radiative acceleration, winds and convection are absent.
An exploratory DO model is not a DOZ model.

A converged flag requires the population defect and the shared all-depth
flux, local cell energy, unrestricted temperature correction, independent
source closure and lower-boundary screening checks. A small surface-flux
error alone cannot establish convergence. The certificate applies only to
the declared equations and structure grid. Independent depth/wavelength
refinement and comparison with observed stars remain separate requirements.
Unconverged outputs warn; `require_convergence=True` rejects them after saving
diagnostics. No observational range is qualified yet.

## External data

The optional CCC and TLUSTY data are not redistributed. Supply a data root
with these files under `cache/` (or `.cache/` for the research workspace):

- `ccc/e-H_XSEC_LS.zip`
- `tlusty-source/tlusty200.f`
- `tlusty-atoms/he1_14lev.dat`

The profiles `helium-stark/Tremblay26.txt` and `helium-stark/he2prf.dat`
are bundled under `wd_spectra/data/runtime/cache/`. When using a custom data
root, copy or link these profiles into its `cache/helium-stark/` directory
too: all `ModelData(root)` paths resolve under that selected root.

Use `ModelData.default(root)` or `OPENWD_DATA`. Missing data produce an
explicit error; the adapter does not replace them with approximate rates or
download them implicitly. The existing research workspace already contains
these inputs. Their existing third-party restrictions still apply.

## Cold-start qualification and runtime

Seven prescribed public configurations have passed from fresh initialization.
No saved atmosphere, populations or Jacobian was supplied. Internal LTE and
Planck-to-NLTE initialization belongs to that same cold invocation. Stellar
parameters, iteration budgets and convergence thresholds were unchanged.

| Preset | Parameters | Resolution | End-to-end time |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| DO standard | 50,000 K, log g=8 | 40 layers, He II 32, 3 angles | 83.90 min |
| DO standard | 60,000 K, log g=8 | 40 layers, He II 32, 3 angles | 57.61 min |
| DO standard | 70,000 K, log g=8 | 40 layers, He II 32, 3 angles | 140.97 min |
| DAO standard | 60,000 K, log g=8, log H/He=2 | 40 layers, He II 32, H8, 3 angles | 282.92 min |
| GD153 standard | 40,204 K, log g=7.82, log H/He=6 | 40 layers, He II 32, H8, 3 angles | 167.06 min |
| GD153 production | Same parameters | 80 layers, He II 8, H8, 4 angles | 124.19 min |
| GD153 production | Same parameters | 80 layers, He II 8, H20, 4 angles | 187.11 min |

These are individual instrumented measurements with concurrent workloads,
not controlled timing comparisons. A standard full Jacobian used about
7.3 GB peak process memory in the response-cache benchmark; larger atoms and
grids need more. Start with one calculation and one BLAS/OpenMP thread.

The seven-point matrix was accumulated across solver revisions, with source
hashes retained per invocation. The final DO50 cold run used the installed
release wheel and the final fresh-tangent recovery. H20 used the preceding
integration; it never activated recovery, so the later recovery-only refinement
was dormant. Other points retain their recorded earlier revisions. This is
not a claim that every point was rerun on one final binary, or a guarantee
throughout a temperature/composition range.

For details see the [release evidence](../development/history/do-dao-release-2026-09-20.md)
and its [machine-readable measurements](../development/history/do-dao-cold-evidence.json).
The release also includes successful public DO/DAO adapter tests, typed trial
failure/backtracking checks, independent Jacobian checks, and optional slow
cold-start canaries.

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[test]'
python -m pytest tests/test_helium_nlte.py tests/test_hot_nlte.py tests/test_hot_structure.py
python -m pytest tests/test_hot_public.py tests/test_hot_error_boundary.py tests/test_hot_recovery_*.py tests/test_hot_response.py

# Seven expensive fresh calculations; requires the external data above.
OPENWD_DATA=/path/to/data OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 \
  python -m pytest -m canary tests/test_hot_cold_canary.py
```

The ordinary tests use synthetic collision input where third-party data cannot
be redistributed, but read the bundled Tremblay profile default. The slow
canaries require actual external physics data and are excluded from fast CI.
Unset `OPENWD_DATA` skips those optional canaries; an explicitly selected but
incomplete data root fails them. The canaries must not be reported as passed
when skipped.

For an instrumented public run, including source hashes and per-stage
numerical diagnostics:

```bash
OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 PYTHONPATH=src \
  python research/run_hot_public_diagnostic.py --data-root /path/to/data \
  --teff 60000 --logg 8 --quality standard --output results/do-public-cold
```

The output must be new. The diagnostic runner writes checkpoints for inspection
but never reads them to initialize a public calculation.

## Observational checks and remaining limitations

The [cold-only six-object comparison](../assets/do-dao-cold-observed.pdf) uses
the same stacked-spectrum style as the DZ/DQ paper figures. The
[full comparison set](../assets/do-dao-cold-variants.pdf) includes all three
GD153 grids. No stellar parameters were fitted. Display normalization differs
from the line-local protocol used for quantitative scores.

At 50,000 K, J034227's observed chi-square is 1.80% lower than legacy.
The 70,000 K model passes both RE 0503-289 and J140409 comparisons. At
60,000 K, J131724 improves but J034101 remains 0.4217% worse than legacy;
its strict no-regression gate fails, mostly in He I 4471. Thus not every
observed target matches legacy at least as well.

GD153's H-alpha normalized RMS is 0.007162 (standard), 0.004937
(production H8), and 0.005138 (production H20), versus 0.002644 for the
separate TMAP pure-H reference. The larger H atom did not improve this score.
These are convergence-qualified calculations, not observational qualification
of the restricted physics.

Public hydrogen controls can be fetched and compared independently:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[validation]'
python research/fetch_hot_hydrogen.py --output results/hot-hydrogen-observed
python research/validate_hot_hydrogen.py --data results/hot-hydrogen-observed \
  --star gd153 --model results/gd153 --output results/gd153-observed
```

The inputs are public CALSPEC STIS spectra of GD153 and G191-B2B, with separate
TMAP/TLUSTY reference spectra and their header parameters. G191-B2B includes
metals missing from these restricted H/He models. The GD153 comparison uses
older STIS resolution metadata because the current file's FWHM column is
malformed. Only observed optical segments are scored. Statistical-error
chi-square omits continuum-fitting and flux-calibration covariance. The
legacy DO comparison additionally requires the separate research workspace's
cached observations and reference spectra; those raw data are not redistributed.
